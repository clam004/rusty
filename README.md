# rusty

Companion hands on guide to [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)
for programmers with a python background or new to low-level systems programming but looking to have these skills taught in an empathetic over-explained manner

Meant to be used in chronological order: part1setup, part2basics... etc, each part folder has a README.md or jupyter notebook inside to follow from top to bottom.
